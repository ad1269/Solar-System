# Solar System

<h3>Details</h3>
This project simulates the solar system by using Newton's Universal Law of Gravitation. It calculates the force applied on each planet by all the other planets, and applies this force on them. Each planet calculates the acceleration and velocity gained as a result of this force, and updates its position on screen.

<h3>Running the Project</h3>
To run the project yourself in XCode, just open the Solar System.xcodeproj project; everything is already ready to be built.

<h3>Example<\h3>
If you can't run the project, you can take a look at Solar System.mov to see a video recording of the app running.
